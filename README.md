In collaboration with [Fong Chan](https://github.com/tinyheero) (Achilles Therapeutics) and [Lu Zhang](https://github.com/LuZhang0128) (University of Chicago), we have developed `plotmm` for tidy visualization of mixture models. This package is a substantial update to the [`plotGMM` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plotGMM).

## Install

Load the latest version:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("pdwaggoner/plotmm")

library(plotmm)
```

Load the latest stable (CRAN) version:

```{r}
install.packages("plotmm")

library(plotmm)
```
